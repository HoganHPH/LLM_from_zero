# Multiple Choice
- Reference: [HuggingFace Task Guides - Multiple Choice](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/multiple_choice)

<p><b>Note*: There is no direct way to use 'pipeline' for inference in Multiple Choice task. Use AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForMultipleChoice is okay. If want to use pipeline, need to convert to another task like Text Classification using a prompt as input for the model.</b></p>
